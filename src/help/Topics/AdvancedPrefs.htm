        To access the advanced preferences panel select the
        <span class="MenuItem">Preferences</span> item on the <span class="MenuItem">Edit</span> menu then

        When the Meazure program terminates, it saves its <a href="Preferences.htm">preference</a>
        settings and the configuration of all <a href="ToolsOverview.htm">tools</a>.
        Upon startup, Meazure reads these preferences and configurations so that the program appears exactly
        as it was left. Meazure allows the configuration of the tools to be saved to a file called a
        <a href="Profiles.htm">profile</a>. You
        can load a profile anytime while running Meazure. You can also specify a profile to be loaded automatically
        when Meazure starts up. The Advanced preferences panel provides a text field for you to enter the pathname
        of a startup profile.

    <div class="Para">
        The Meazure program is highly configurable and it is possible to get to a point where it may be
        desirable to restore the program's original configuration. The Advanced preferences panel provides
        a Master Reset button to restore the default program configuration. Pressing the Master Reset button
        displays a confirmation dialog. If the reset is confirmed, all program settings are returned to
        their original values including the appearance of the measurement tools. Note that following a reset
        the position of the measurement tools is not changed but the selected tool is changed to the Cursor tool.
